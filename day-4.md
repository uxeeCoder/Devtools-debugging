# Web Performance Optimization

## Lighthouse Audit
 Ran Lighthouse audit on my portfolio main page and captured the results of it.  
 I was able to see minor issues with the code in index.html file where Form element for= First name was written in lowercase while id was as First Name in uppercase which i fixed and it resolved the issue showing in the screenshot on the top right side as a small red message icon. Good use of Debugging tool to find even minor errors in the code.
